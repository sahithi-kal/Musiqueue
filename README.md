# Musiqueue
>A playlist crowdsourcing app for every party

Musiqueue is crowdsourcing DJ app that allows event attendees to add songs to a playlist for event. Attendees can also view the playlist and see the current song playing, get information about songs on the playlist and upvote/downvote songs based on what they want to hear. Event hosts have the ability to control the playlist, adding, deleting and reordering songs as they see fit. Musiqueue allows attendees to determine their own party experience but giving them control of the music.
